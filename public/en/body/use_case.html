                        Today is our first day of using AngelTalk. It is good for me that AngelTalk prevents Jungmin from watching Youtube. We are practicing with the cards regarding food.
                         Jungmin feels uncomfortable with the app; He is reluctant to use it whenever I show him cards instead of real things.

                        Jungmin and I are practicing with ’Snack,’ ‘Water,’ and ‘Banana’ cards in AngelTalk. He seemed interested as I gave him food when he touched a card. I keep disciplining him to use the app if he wants something to eat.

                        He started expressing what he would like to eat by using AngelTalk. He knows when AngelTalk app will appear on my smartphone
When he picked one among the food cards, I gave him some foods that he chooses. As usual, I gave some snack after dinner, but he kept touching the ‘Rice’ card. So I gave rice instead of snacks. He was jubilant about it.
I prepared the food listed in AngelTalk app and gave some when he touches the card in the app. I guess he is getting used to it more and more as a result of it. Now Jungmin and I feel comfortable with talking to each other by using AngelTalk.

                        Jungmin is trying to find my smartphone if he wants to eat something even when he is playing.
It is sure he is looking for AngelTalk app.

He swipes the cards back and forth and touches the ‘Rice’ card if he wants some.
He keeps touching ‘Rice’ if he wants more even after dinner.

Now all family members know he clearly demands particular food, not any food.
Jungmin’s brother regrets that he has kept giving snacks as guessing that Jungmin liked those, so do I. I’ve never thought of it.

He likes it.

This night he keeps touching ‘Amusement Park’ card.
Is he truly wanna go there?</pre>

                        It’s been a month since I started using AngelTalk. Now he expresses what he wants well.
I can distinguish his wanting from just touching accidentally.
If he really wants something, he presses the card and looks at me. He keeps tapping the card over and over again if he doesn’t get it immediately.
“Give me some banana,” “Give me some banana.”...

Recently, he mastered moving from one category to the other. If he chooses an unwanted category, he immediately taps ‘backward’ button and then chooses the one that he wants.

His father and brother were amazed at his using the app and felt Jungmin more adorable. Jungmin also liked it when others responded to what he wants. How frustrated he has been so far!</pre>
