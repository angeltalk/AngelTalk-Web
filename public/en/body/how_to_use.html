                        Use real pictures or short video clips of the things that your child want to express, and record your own voice to gain your child’s attention.


                        i. Prepare something you want to take a picture of it.

                        ii. Before running the app,  choose the name of the card carefully and practice to pronounce it correctly, so that your child can easily recognize your voice and its meaning clearly.

                        iii. Run the app on your smartphone and choose one of the existing categories where your card will be placed.

                        iv. Tap the ‘New Card’ button,  and follow the instructions.

                        * In some circumstances, you might not have enough time to make the card completely. 
                        Don’t worry about it. In which case just capture the picture of what you want by using your camera app. 
                        Later, you can make the card with that picture.

                        Worrying about abuse of smartphone by your child?
                        Our app uses the lock screen of your smartphone. You can hand it to your child, anytime you want.


                        i. Pull down the notification drawer of your smartphone.

                        ii. Find the AngelTalk among a bunch of bars, and press the ‘ON’ button in the AngelTalk bar.

                        iii. Now, AngelTalk app will appear on the lock screen. You can hand your smartphone to your child.

                        At a particular time, you may think that some cards are not appropriate to show them to your child.
                         Instead of deleting those cards permanently, you can just hide them so that your child are not able to see them in AngelTalk.<br /><br />
                        <span>CHANGE SORT ORDER </span>
                        As your child grows, his or her interest changes. You can place the most attractive card in upper position and lower the position of less intersting cards. Your child doesn’t need to swipe too many cards to find a proper one.<br /><br />
                        <span>CHANGE CARD NAME, VOICE, etc.</span>
                        It’s easy and simple. It takes only a few second to change those.

                        As a mom, you’ve made some cards. Your child likes those cards.  What about your husband?<br/>

                        Your child’s language pathologist said that she taught a new word to your child today, and he seemed to wanna talk about it. So, you made a card with the picture of similar things that appeared to represent the new word.However, your child doesn’t think your card was identical to the one at the language center.
                         What should you do?<br/>
